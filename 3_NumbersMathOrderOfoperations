print(1+2*3)          # Outputs 7. Multiplies 2*3 first then adds 1.
print((1 + 2) * 3)    # Outputs 9. Parenthesis beats multiplication.
print(18 / 4)         # Outputs 4.5. In python 2 it rounds down to 4.
print(3**3)           # 3 raised to the power of 3, or 3 cubed.
print(18 % 4)         # The modulo operator ,%, outputs the remainder of 18/4 which is 2.
print(1 - 2 * 3 % 4)  # * and % operators have the same rank, calculates from left to right. 2*3=6, 6%4=2, 1-2=-1
